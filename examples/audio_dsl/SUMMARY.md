# Audio DSL Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully created a comprehensive audio DSL with support for:
- Fourier and Laplace transforms
- WAV file handling (16/24/32-bit)
- Audio editing operations (cut, copy, paste, trim)
- Signal processing (filters, compression, resampling)
- Spectrum and phase analysis

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Transform Operations
- **FFT**: Fast Fourier Transform with window functions (Hamming, Hanning, Blackman, Rectangular)
- **IFFT**: Inverse FFT for time-domain reconstruction
- **Laplace Transform**: For system analysis
- **Inverse Laplace**: Transform back to time domain

### 2. Audio Processing
- **Filters**: Lowpass, highpass, bandpass, notch filters
- **Compression**: MP3, FLAC, Opus simulation
- **Resampling**: Sample rate conversion
- **Normalization**: Peak level optimization
- **Amplification**: Gain control with dB support

### 3. Wave Editing
- **Mark**: Set time markers
- **Cut/Copy/Paste**: Clipboard operations
- **Trim**: Keep specific time ranges

### 4. File Operations
- **Load/Save**: WAV file I/O
- **Multiple bit depths**: 16, 24, 32-bit support

## DSL Command Examples

```dsl
# Load and analyze
load "input.wav"
fft with window hamming
spectrum
phase

# Process audio
normalize
filter lowpass 2000 Hz
amplify 6 dB

# Edit operations
mark at 1.5s
copy from 0.5s to 1.0s
paste at 2.0s
trim from 0s to 3s

# Save results
compress type flac ratio 4
save "output.wav"
```

## Technical Implementation

### Parser Integration
- Uses go-dsl framework with keyword tokens for reserved words
- Implements proper rule ordering (longer patterns first)
- Action functions for each command

### Signal Processing
- Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm
- Butterworth filter implementations
- Linear interpolation for resampling
- Window functions for spectral analysis

### WAV Format
- Full WAV header parsing/generation
- Multi-channel support (mono/stereo)
- Sample rate preservation
- Proper byte ordering (little-endian)

## Testing
All commands tested and verified:
- ✅ File operations (load/save)
- ✅ FFT/IFFT transforms
- ✅ Laplace transforms
- ✅ All filter types
- ✅ Audio editing operations
- ✅ Compression/decompression
- ✅ Resampling
- ✅ Spectrum/phase analysis

## Usage

### As a Library
```go
import "github.com/arturoeanton/go-dsl/examples/audio_dsl/universal"

audioDSL := universal.NewAudioDSL()
result, err := audioDSL.Parse("load \"audio.wav\"")
```

### Direct Engine Access
```go
engine := audioDSL.GetEngine()
engine.LoadWAV("audio.wav")
engine.FFT("hamming")
engine.SaveWAV("output.wav")
```

## Performance Characteristics
- FFT: O(n log n) complexity
- In-memory processing (suitable for files < 1GB)
- Real-time capable for basic operations

## Future Enhancements
The architecture supports easy extension for:
- Streaming processing
- Additional codecs
- More window functions
- Advanced filters (Chebyshev, Elliptic)
- Pitch shifting
- Time stretching
- Convolution reverb

## Conclusion
The audio DSL provides a powerful, extensible framework for audio processing with a clean, natural language interface. The universal pattern allows easy deployment by copying the folder structure.
