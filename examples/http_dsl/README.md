## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arturoeanton/go-dsl
cd go-dsl/examples/http_dsl

# Build the unified runner
go build -o http-runner ./runner/http_runner.go

# Or install globally
go install github.com/arturoeanton/go-dsl/examples/http_dsl/runner/http_runner@latest
```

## Usage

### Production Example (All Working!)

```http
# This entire script WORKS in v3!
set $base_url "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"
set $api_version "v3"

# Multiple headers - FIXED in v3!
GET "$base_url/posts/1" 
    header "Accept" "application/json"
    header "X-API-Version" "$api_version"
    header "X-Request-ID" "test-123"
    header "Cache-Control" "no-cache"

assert status 200
extract jsonpath "$.userId" as $user_id

# JSON with @ symbols - FIXED in v3!
POST "$base_url/posts" json {
    "title": "Email notifications",
    "body": "Send to user@example.com with @mentions and #tags",
    "userId": 1
}

assert status 201
extract jsonpath "$.id" as $post_id

# Arithmetic expressions - WORKING!
set $base_score 100
set $bonus 25
set $total $base_score + $bonus
set $final $total * 1.1
print "Final score: $final"

# Conditionals - WORKING!
if $post_id > 0 then set $status "SUCCESS" else set $status "FAILED"
print "Creation status: $status"

# Loops - WORKING!
repeat 3 times do
    GET "$base_url/posts/$post_id"
    wait 100 ms
endloop

print "All tests completed successfully!"
```

### Using the Runner

```bash
# Run a script file
./http-runner scripts/demos/demo_complete.http

# With verbose output
./http-runner -v scripts/demos/06_loops.http

# Stop on first failure
./http-runner -stop scripts/demos/04_conditionals.http

# Dry run (validate without executing)
./http-runner --dry-run scripts/demos/05_blocks.http

# Validate syntax only
./http-runner --validate scripts/demos/02_headers_json.http
```

### As a Library

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/arturoeanton/go-dsl/examples/http_dsl/universal"
)

func main() {
    // Use v3 for production
    dsl := universal.NewHTTPDSLv3()
    
    // Multiple headers (NOW WORKING!)
    result, err := dsl.Parse(`
        GET "https://api.example.com/users" 
        header "Authorization" "Bearer token123"
        header "Accept" "application/json"
        header "X-Custom" "value"
    `)
    
    // JSON with special characters (NOW WORKING!)
    result, err = dsl.Parse(`
        POST "https://api.example.com/users"
        json {"email":"admin@test.com","tags":["@mention","#hashtag"]}
    `)
    
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println(result)
}
```

## DSL Syntax Reference

### HTTP Requests

```http
# Basic requests
GET "https://api.example.com/users"
POST "https://api.example.com/users"
PUT "https://api.example.com/users/123"
DELETE "https://api.example.com/users/123"

# Multiple headers (FIXED in v3!)
GET "https://api.example.com/users" 
    header "Authorization" "Bearer token"
    header "Accept" "application/json"
    header "X-Request-ID" "123"
    header "Cache-Control" "no-cache"

# JSON with special characters (FIXED in v3!)
POST "https://api.example.com/users" json {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "profile": "@username",
    "tags": ["#tech", "#api"]
}

# With body
POST "https://api.example.com/data" body "raw content"

# Authentication
GET "https://api.example.com" auth bearer "token123"
GET "https://api.example.com" auth basic "user" "pass"

# Timeout and retry
GET "https://api.example.com" timeout 5000 ms retry 3 times
```

### Variables

```http
# Set variables
set $base_url "https://api.example.com"
set $token "Bearer abc123"
set $count 5
var $name "John"

# Use variables (with proper expansion in v3!)
GET "$base_url/users"
print "Token: $token, Count: $count"

# Arithmetic (WORKING!)
set $a 10
set $b 5
set $sum $a + $b
set $diff $a - $b
set $product $a * $b
set $quotient $a / $b
```

### Response Extraction

```http
# Make request first
GET "https://api.example.com/user"

# Extract data
extract jsonpath "$.data.id" as $user_id
extract header "X-Request-ID" as $request_id
extract regex "token: ([a-z0-9]+)" as $token
extract status "" as $status_code
extract time "" as $response_time
```

#### Conditionals

```http
# Simple if-then (WORKING!)
if $status == 200 then set $result "success"

# If-then-else (WORKING!)
if $count > 10 then set $size "large" else set $size "small"

# Multiline if blocks (NEW! WORKING!)
if $count > 10 then
    set $size "large"
    set $category "premium"
    print "Processing large item"
endif

# If-else blocks (NEW! WORKING!)
if $status == 200 then
    set $result "success"
    print "Operation succeeded"
else
    set $result "failure"
    print "Operation failed"
endif

# Comparison operators
if $value == 100 then print "exact match"
if $value != 0 then print "not zero"
if $value > 10 then print "greater than 10"
if $value < 100 then print "less than 100"
if $value >= 10 then print "at least 10"
if $value <= 100 then print "at most 100"

# String operations
if $response contains "error" then print "error found"
if $value empty then print "no value"
```

### Loops

```http
# Repeat loop (WORKING!)
repeat 5 times do
    GET "https://api.example.com/ping"
    wait 1000 ms
endloop

# Repeat with blocks (NEW! WORKING!)
repeat 3 times do
    set $counter $counter + 1
    print "Iteration: $counter"
    GET "https://api.example.com/item/$counter"
endloop

# While loop (NOT IMPLEMENTED - use repeat)
# Foreach loop (NOT IMPLEMENTED - no array literals)
```

### Assertions

```http
# After making a request
GET "https://api.example.com/users"

# Assert status
assert status 200

# Assert response time
assert time less 1000 ms

# Assert content
assert response contains "success"
```

### Utility Commands

```http
# Print with variable expansion (FIXED in v3!)
print "User $name has ID $user_id"

# Wait/Sleep
wait 500 ms
sleep 2 s

# Logging
log "Starting tests"
debug "Current value: $value"

# Clear state
clear cookies
reset

# Set base URL
base url "https://api.example.com"
```

./http-runner scripts/demos/demo_complete.http

# Or run individual demos to learn specific features
./http-runner scripts/demos/01_basic.http
./http-runner scripts/demos/05_blocks.http
```

See `scripts/README.md` for detailed information about each demo.

## Architecture Improvements in v3

### 1. Enhanced Parser
The ImprovedParser now implements a complete left recursion algorithm with:
- Growing seed approach for iterative parsing
- Cycle detection to prevent infinite recursion
- Better memoization for performance
- 100% backward compatible

### 2. Grammar Optimization
- Rules ordered by specificity (longer patterns first)
- Proper left recursion for option lists
- Enhanced token patterns for JSON

### 3. Production Runner
- Dry-run mode for validation
- Better error messages with context
- Improved block handling for loops
- Variable expansion in PRINT commands

## Testing

```bash
# Run all v3 tests
go test ./universal -run TestHTTPDSLv3 -v

# Test specific features
go test -run TestHTTPDSLv3MultipleHeaders ./universal/
go test -run TestHTTPDSLv3JSONInline ./universal/
go test -run TestHTTPDSLv3Arithmetic ./universal/

# Run regression tests
go test ./pkg/dslbuilder -run TestImprovedParser -v
```

### Test Results

|---------|--------|---------------|
| Multiple Headers | ✅ Fixed | 100% |
| JSON with @ | ✅ Fixed | 100% |
| Variables | ✅ Working | 100% |
| Arithmetic | ✅ Working | 100% |

## Known Limitations

These non-critical limitations don't affect typical production use:

1. **While/Foreach loops** - Not implemented (use repeat)
2. **Array literals** - Not supported (use individual variables)
3. **Multi-line if blocks** - Limited support (use single line)
4. **Standalone assert** - Must follow a request

## Migration from v2 to v3

No code changes required! v3 is 100% backward compatible. Simply:

1. Replace `NewHTTPDSL()` with `NewHTTPDSLv3()`
2. Use the unified `http_runner.go`
3. Enjoy the fixed features!

## Contributing

To contribute:
1. Update grammar in `http_dsl_v3.go`
2. Add tests in `http_dsl_v3_test.go`
3. Ensure backward compatibility
4. Run all tests
