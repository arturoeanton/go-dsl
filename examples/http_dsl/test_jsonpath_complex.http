# First make a request to get some data
GET "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"

# Test simple JSONPath (should work)
extract jsonpath "$[0].id" as $first_id
print "First ID: $first_id"

# Test complex JSONPath with filter
extract jsonpath "$[?(@.userId == 1)].title" as $titles
print "Titles from user 1: $titles"
